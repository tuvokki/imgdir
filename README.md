# imgdir
Osx compatible image directory browser with delete

## Reasoning
Most image handling programs have about 1000 different functions but lack some basic directory browser, which is sometimes all I want. Just point to a directory with 753 newly downloaded wallpapers and press next to keep an image and delete to throw them out (if it's another sportscar).
